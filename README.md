This is my first attempt at this kind of thing so I'm not sure if I got it right.

This is the beta version of GCG's Debt Token. 

ERC-1404 Standard

The node_modules file is huge so after cloning run: `$ npm install`

I'll begin with what I was trying to accomplish which is implement the 1404 standard on a token that is indivisible, has a maximum number of shareholders, has a managed whitelist and a paymentsplitter to send ETH back to the address that hold the token.
